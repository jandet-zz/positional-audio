# Positional Audio

Modular approach to using the Web Audio API w/ positional audio and attaching to "player" objects.

## Status: In Progress

## TODO:
### Write tests
### Update for spec compliance
### Make compiled dist version
### Add environmental convolution (?)

A nice wrapper for web audio, to make your life happy and fun (like it would be if you were eating a cronut).
